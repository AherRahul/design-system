# AlertCard

### AlertCards are components used to convey important contextual messages and present possible actions to be taken based on them.
---
<br />

## When to use:
- It is necessary to show extensive contextual information.
- It is necessary to show contextual information that requires user actions on it.

<br />

## When not to use:
- It is necessary to show information in a discreet way or in a way that can be hidden. In this case, we recommend using b-toasts.
- It is necessary to show short contextual information.

## Preview

export const title = 'AlertCard Title';

export const subTitle =  `There is a theory that says that if one day someone 
discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will disappear 
instantly and be replaced by something still stranger and more inexplicable. 
There is a second theory that says that this has already happened.`;
