# Cores

Colors are important for identifying our product, in addition to helping to create consistent experiences across our solutions.

<hr />
<br />

## Recommendations

-  To better differentiate between different types of data and information, when using maps and tables, we recommend using multiple colors.

-  To best communicate the main purpose of the interface, we recommend using the primary color only once per page, or as little as necessary.

-  To facilitate the construction of mental models of interface use, we recommend using colors consistently to represent status, feedback messages and conventions.

E.g.: blue links, red validation messages, blue or green success messages.

## Comments:
- We recommend using the gradient token as the background of applications. To use it, assign the token to the background property.
