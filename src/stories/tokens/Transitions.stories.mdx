# Transitions

Transition tokens are used to smooth interactions with RDS components.

<hr />
<br />

## Recommendations

- Transition tokens were created imagining their use in specific 
interactions (click, hover, appearance on the screen). Avoid using 
tokens in situations that are very different from those for which they were designed.

## Comments
- Hovering over the example illustration in the table will show transition examples using the tokens.

<br />

## Tokens
Border-radius tokens are scss variables and are described below.

<br />

export const Template = (args) => ({
	setup() {
		return { args };
	},
	components: { Transitions },
	template:`<transitions />`,
});

<Story name="transitions">
	{ Template.bind({}) }
</Story>
