# Iconography

The iconography we use in Cuida simplifies user interaction with the system, 
as it allows elements to be more easily identified. Furthermore, it allows 
users to more easily understand the layout components, reducing the learning curve on the interface.

## Recommendations

- To better represent system icons, we recommend using icons with a size between 
20 x 20 and 24 x 24 pixels.

- For better understanding by the user, use icons already commonly adopted for the 
desired function. For example, a bell for notifications, a gear for settings, etc.

- To make content clearer, use icons in conjunction with text whenever possible.

## Icons

RDS implements a component-shaped wrapper for RDSIcons icons . Any maintenance 
or improvements must be made to the respective project and design kit in Figma and, 
if necessary, updated here.
