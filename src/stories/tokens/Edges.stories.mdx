# Edges

Border-radius tokens are used to round the corners of interface components, 
making them more subtle, friendly and organic. At Cuida, we value somewhat 
rounded edges, which grow according to the size of the component.

<hr />
<br />

## Recommendations

- We do not recommend using components with border-radius equal to 0, as they 
go against the visual language we are building.

- We do not recommend using very rounded edges on small elements. The goal is 
to have more organic edges, not rounded elements.

- We recommend that elements have uniform border-radius, so our tokens do not 
predict scenarios in which an element has different border-radius for each of 
its corners. If we see this need, we will work on it in the future.

## Tokens
Border-radius tokens are scss variables and are described below.

export const Template = (args) => ({
	setup() {
		return { args };
	},
	components: { Border },
	template:`<border />`,
});

<Story name="borda">
	{ Template.bind({}) }
</Story>
